## About Me
I began my journey as a mathematics enthusiast, captivated by the elegance of linear algebra, calculus, and probability â€” the three fundamental vectors that once spanned my intellectual space. My gateway into artificial intelligence was Andrew Ngâ€™s seminal Machine Learning course, where I discovered that AI is, at its core, a symphony orchestrated by these mathematical harmonies. Since then, Iâ€™ve found deep joy in this symphony â€” representing the world through tensors, uncovering structure through calculus, and reasoning under uncertainty through probability distributions.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU). My academic foundation in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science enables me to explore interdisciplinary problems at the intersection of Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and Robotics.

My overarching research vision is to contribute toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) â€” intelligent robotic systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting with human-like understanding. I aim to reverse-engineer human cognition by studying how we perceive and integrate multisensory information, enabling the development of robots that can perceive, plan, reason, and manipulate within complex environments â€” just as humans do.

I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin under Prof.[Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q), while pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science.
I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun), and [Rabin Dhakal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
