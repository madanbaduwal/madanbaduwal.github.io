My journey began with a deep fascination for **physics**, **chemistry**, and **biology**-further inspired by **neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy**-and a desire to understand the fundamental rules of nature and to solve meaningful problems across domains such as **healthcare/medicine**, **engineering**, **entertainment**, **agriculture**, **social computing**, **economics & finance**... .

I approach problem-solving in three steps:


**Input Space**  
- **Mathematics**: represent any kind of data as numbers (-infinity ... 0 ... +infinity)
- **Computer Science**: store it in data structures like **list**, **dictionary**, **set**, **tuple**… or finally in **bits** (e.g., `100101`)

**Processing**  
- **Mathematics**: apply **functions** (+, -, *, /, etc.)  
- **Computer Science**: apply **algorithms** to the input space

**Output Space**  
- **Mathematics**: represent any kind of data as numbers (-infinity... 0 ... +infinity)  
- **Computer Science**: store it in data structures like **list**, **dictionary**, **set**, **tuple**… or finally in **bits** (e.g., `100101`)


**Goal: Mathematical Modeling of Humans/Animals(Cognition and Neuroscience)**: Perception / Observation, Understanding, Word Model / State Representation, Memory, Goal/Objective, Reasoning, Planning/Path planning, Decision-Making / Policy, Tool Interference / Act /Control & Manipulation / Action / Actuation , Feedback / Observation Loop , Learning / Continual learning / Adaptation, Reflection / Self-Monitoring (optional but powerful)… .


**English**, **mathematics**, and **computer science (CS)** soon became the languages through which I explored this curiosity. 
Today, I use **Mathematics** (**sets**, **linear algebra**, **calculus**, **probability & statistics**) and **Computer Science** (**algorithms**, **machine learning**, **system design**) to explore nature’s principles and develop **intelligent systems** that solve real-world problems across domains. My ultimate vision is to create **robots** capable of investigating the fundamental laws of nature and addressing the challenges faced by living beings.

I am currently pursuing a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at **Mississippi State University (MSU)**, where my research spans **Multimodal Machine Learning** and **Wireless Communication**. Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) under the supervision of [**Prof. Quan Yuan**](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q) while completing my Master’s in Computer Science. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, where I worked under the guidance of [**Prof. Sanjeev Prasad Panday**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I have also had the privilege of collaborating with [**Mahabir Pun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun) and [**Rabin Dhakal**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
