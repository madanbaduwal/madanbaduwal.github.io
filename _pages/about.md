## About Me
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU). My academic background spans **Physics, Math,& CS**, providing a strong interdisciplinary foundation for my research. My PhD work lies at the intersection of **Wireless Communication and Signal Processing, Multimodal Machine Learning, Quantum Machine Learning, and Robotics.** 

My long-term research objective is to investigate how humans perceive, process, and integrate multisensory information to make informed decisions. Ultimately, my goal is to reverse-engineer aspects of human cognition to develop robotic systems capable of **Perception Understanding, Planning/Navigation/Reasoning, and Control/Manipulation/Policy Learning**. This vision is directed toward creating intelligent robots that can see, listen, speak, learn, and interact with human-like adaptability and social intelligence.

I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin under Prof.[Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q), while pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science.
I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun), and [Rabin Dhakal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
