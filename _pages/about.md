Hi there! Thank you for visiting my personal webpage. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU).

My research interests lie in Cognitive neuroscience, Data Structure and Algorithms, Deep Learning(Multimodal Learning, Generative AI, LLM), Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Wireless Communication, Software Engineering, and Robotics. I am particularly interested in reverse-engineering the human mind to build embodied machines that can see, listen, speak, learn, and interact with human-level cognition and social intelligence.



I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin under Prof.[Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q), while pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science.
I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun), and [Rabin Dhakal](https://rabindhakal.com/). If you are interested in discussing research, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madanbaduwal), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MadanBaduwal1). You can also send me an email: ```madanbaduwal100@gmail.com```.
