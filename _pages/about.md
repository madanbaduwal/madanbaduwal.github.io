Hi there! Thank you for visiting my personal webpage. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU).

My academic foundation lies in **Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Wireless Communication & Signal Processing**, **Multimodal Machine Learning**, **Quantum Machine Learning**, and **Robotics**. I explore how humans perceive, process, and integrate information from multiple senses to make informed decisions. My ultimate goal is to reverse-engineer aspects of human cognition to develop robots capable of seeing, listening, speaking, learning, and interacting with human-like perception, reasoning, and social intelligence.



I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin under Prof.[Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q), while pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science.
I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun), and [Rabin Dhakal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
