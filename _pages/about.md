Hi there! Thanks for visiting my personal webpage. I'm a dedicated and experienced Machine Learning Software Engineer. With a strong academic background in computer science and mathematics, combined with practical industry experience, I excel at utilizing engineering and machine learning techniques to generate actionable insights and create impactful solutions.

My research interests lie in Cognitive neuroscience, Data Structure and Algorithms, Deep Learning(Multimodal Learning, Generative AI, LLM), Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,Software Engineering, and Robotics. In particular I am interested in reverse-engineering the human mind to build embodied machines that can see, listen, speak, learn, and interact with human-level cognition and social intelligence.


I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at The University Of Texas Permian Basin(UTPB), conducting research under [Prof. Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q) in machine learning and deep learning, particularly in transformer-based architectures and diffusion models.

I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University , under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en).I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun) , [Rabin Dhakal](https://rabindhakal.com/). If you are interested in discussing research, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madanbaduwal), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MadanBaduwal1).
