## About Me
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU). My academic background spans **Physics, Math,& CS**, providing a strong interdisciplinary foundation for my research. My PhD work lies at the intersection of **Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, and Robotics.** 

My long-term research goal is to reverse-engineer human cognition by understanding how we **perceive** and **integrate multisensory information**, enabling the development of intelligent robots capable of **Perception Understanding, Planning/Navigation/Reasoning, and Control/Manipulation/Policy Learning** with human-like intelligence.


I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin under Prof.[Quan Yuan](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q), while pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science.
I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University, under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). I am lucky to have opportunities to work with [Mahabir Pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun), and [Rabin Dhakal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
