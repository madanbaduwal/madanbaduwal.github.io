## About Me  

My journey began with a fascination for **Physics**, **Chemistry**, and **Biology**, a quest to understand the **fundamental rules of nature**. **Mathematics** soon became my language for that pursuit; my intellectual space was spanned by three basis vectors: **Linear Algebra**, **Calculus**, and **Probability**.  

Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning course introduced me to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, where I realized that AI is a symphony composed of mathematical harmonies. Since then, Iâ€™ve been immersed in this symphony, representing data as **tensors**, uncovering structure through **calculus**, and reasoning through **probability distributions**.  

Today, I use Mathematics and Computer Science, from algorithms to AI, to explore **natureâ€™s principles** and develop intelligent systems that solve **real-world problems**. My ultimate vision is to create AGI-driven robots capable of investigating the fundamental laws of nature and addressing the challenges faced by living beings.  

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Mississippi State University (MSU), where my research spans **Signal Processing**, **Machine Learning**, **Quantum Computing**, and **Robotics**.  

Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) under the supervision of [**Prof. Quan Yuan**](https://www.utpb.edu/directory/faculty-staff/yuan_q) while completing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, where I worked under the guidance of [**Prof. Sanjeev Prasad Panday**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en).  

I have also had the privilege of collaborating with [**Mahabir Pun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun) and [**Rabin Dhakal**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i7ETIcsAAAAJ&hl=en).
